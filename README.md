## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Iâ€™m an NLP engineer specializing in building robust models for text classification, named entity recognition (NER), and sentiment analysis using Python and spaCy. This repository showcases my work in developing state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) applications, from preprocessing raw text to fine-tuning and evaluating models. If you're interested in NLP techniques or building your own text-based models, you'll find a collection of useful tools and examples here.

A key aspect of my workflow is text preprocessing. I focus on transforming raw text into structured data that can be fed into machine learning models. Using spaCy and other Python libraries, I implement techniques like tokenization, lemmatization, stop word removal, and named entity recognition (NER). By cleaning and normalizing text data, I ensure that models can focus on the most meaningful features and patterns, improving their accuracy and robustness.

The heart of any NLP project is model training. I build and fine-tune models for a variety of tasks, including text classification, NER, and sentiment analysis, using both pre-trained models and custom architectures. By leveraging spaCy's efficient pipelines and integrating machine learning frameworks like scikit-learn and TensorFlow, I ensure that the models are both performant and scalable for real-world applications. I also work with transfer learning techniques to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks and datasets.

Performance evaluation is essential in understanding how well a model is performing. I use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model effectiveness. Additionally, I implement cross-validation and confusion matrices to gain deeper insights into model strengths and weaknesses, ensuring that the final model is ready for production.

Feel free to explore my projects, fork them, or contribute. I hope you find these resources helpful in your own NLP journey. Thanks for checking out my work!
